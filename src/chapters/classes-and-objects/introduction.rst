Let's Talk About Classes and Objects
====================================

Classes are a relatively new addition to JavaScript. The **class** keyword was introduced in 2015 with the release of ES6. We can think of a class as the blueprint/template for an Object. When an Object(instance) of the class is created it is initialized with values for the properties(parameters) of the class. 
   
Classes make our code reusable.  One can make multiple objects from the same class.  Each one with the same properties but with different values unique to the individual object.
